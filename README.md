# CPPractice

INTRO: This repo is where I am implementing some simple C++ projects to improve at the language. In order to get a solid and low level understanding of everything happening, and to prep for interviews, I am touching a lot of low level concepts & trying to implement a lot of memory management. This is also my practice for implementing some data structures and algorithms.

Project 1 (May 23 - May 25) Implementation of dynamic array, and using it to handle buffer overflow from a fixed size character buffer. Use of peek and get, etcetera to get all the input over, push it into dynamically resizing array, and then give the user the option to accept a shortened name, reversed name, or induce a memory leak if neither option is selected. Also some nice practice of OOP but debugging this thing took until like 2am!
